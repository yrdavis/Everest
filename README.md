# What's this?
This project has been forked from [Rohit Awate](https://github.com/RohitAwate).

We will be using it to learn about JavaFX in the context of an already existing codebase.

# To get it running...
1. Clone this repository.
2. From Eclipse, File > Import > Existing Maven Projects.
3. Under src/main/java > com.rohitawakte.everest, right click Launcher, and Run As > Java Application.

# What's to learn
1. Watch the introduction video: [Getting to grips with an existing JavaFX project](https://youtu.be/csYEFIS89HM)
2. [optional] Play with the color theme if you like.
3. Change the color of "GET" in the history pane to something other than red.
4. Add a button that clears the results from the history pane.
5. Watch the second video: [Adding event handling to an existing JavaFX project](https://youtu.be/3BzOA3sCD8Q)
6. Warn the user before exiting when the last tab is closed. You could use the JavaFX [Alert](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Alert.html) class for this, but it's up to you.
7. Get the copy button working.
8. [optional] When a response is returned, color an "202 OK" status green, and make "404 Not Found" red.
